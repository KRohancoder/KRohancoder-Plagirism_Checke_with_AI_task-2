Plagiarism Detector in Python using Machine Learning Techniques, this is allowcated project by [Codeclause](https://codeclause.com/)

# Discription üìÄ

The program reads text files from the folder, named as Docs under the current 
working directory. It reads all the text files having names Text_?.txt where ?
is to be replaced with any digit between 0 to 9.

The program applies word embedding techniques and first converts the textual 
data, read from the files, into an array of numbers (word vectors) using 
Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) method. For this purpose, 
TfidfVectorizer of scikit-learn built-in features is used.

All the pairs of word vecotrs are then processed for checking of any plagiarism 
between the corresponding text files. This is accomplished by computing the 
value of cosine similarity between the vectors representations of the concerned
text files.

Finally, a table of plagiarism percentage between every pair of files, read 
from the Docs folder is prepared along with presenting the result in Bar Graph.
